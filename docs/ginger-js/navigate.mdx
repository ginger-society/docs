# Linking and Navigating

There are currently two ways to navigate between routes in gingerJs:

Using the Link Component (currently exported from libs)
Using the useNavigate hook (currently exported from libs)


This page will go through how to use each of these options, and dive deeper into how navigation works.

```jsx
import React from "react"
import Link from "src/libs/Link";
import useNavigate from "src/libs/navigate";

function Header(){
    const navigate = useNavigate()
    return (
        <nav>
            <Link to="/features" className="text-sm font-medium hover:underline underline-offset-4"> 
                Features
            </Link>
            <button onClick={()=>{
                navigate("/about-us")
            }}>About Us</button>
        </nav>
    )
}

export default Header
```
