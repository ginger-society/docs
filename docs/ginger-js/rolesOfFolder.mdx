# Roles of folder and files

GingerJs employs a file-system based routing system:

- Folders define routes, with each route corresponding to a path of nested folders, starting from the root directory down to a final folder containing a `index.jsx` file.
- Files create the UI displayed for each route segment.

## Route Segments

Each folder in the route corresponds to a segment of the URL path.

## Nested Routes

To create a nested route, simply place folders within one another. For instance, you can create a `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two folders in the app directory.

The `/dashboard/settings` route consists of three segments:

- `/` 
- `dashboard` 
- `settings`

## File Conventions

GingerJs provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

| **File**        | **Description**                                     |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `index.py`     | Unique Server route which is used to serve the (index.jsx) and pass props (UI data) from server to client         |
| `index.jsx`          | Unique UI of a route and makes routes publicly accessible |
| `middleware.py`  | Middleware functions for processing requests       |
| `layout.jsx`        | Shared UI for a segment and its children            |
| `layout.py`        | Used to pass props (UI data) from server to client (layout.jsx)            |
| `loading.jsx`       | Loading UI for a segment and its children           |
| `page_not_found.jsx`     | Not found UI for a segment and its children         |
