# Meta Data

Metadata plays a crucial role in enhancing and managing your application's content. By embedding metadata within your framework, you can provide essential information about your app's components, improve SEO, and facilitate better data handling.

This section will guide you through the various types of metadata you can use within the framework, how to implement them, and best practices for maximizing their effectiveness. Whether you're setting up page titles, descriptions, or custom data attributes, understanding metadata is key to building a robust and well-organized application.

```python
# add the below in your index.py file
def meta_data():
    return {
        "title": "Ginger-Js",
        "description": "Some Description",
        "og:description": "Description Here",
        "icon":"/static/images/favicon.ico"
    }
```
