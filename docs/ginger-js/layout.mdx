# Layout

A layout is UI that is shared between multiple routes. On navigation, layouts preserve state, remain interactive. Layouts can also be nested.

You can define a layout by default exporting a React component from a layout.jsx file. The component will be populated with a child layout (if it exists) or a page during rendering.

### Server Example

Path Example : `src/app/layout.py`
```python
def layout(request):
    return {"isDev":"true"}

```

Note: Returned data will be accessible through props in Page

### Client Example

Path Example : `src/app/layout.jsx`
```jsx
import React from "react";
import Header from "../components/header";
import { Outlet } from "react-router-dom";

const Layout = (props) => {
  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <Header />
      <Outlet />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Layout;

```


For example, the layout will be shared with the /dashboard and /dashboard/settings pages:

If you were to combine the two layouts above, the root layout (app/layout.jsx) would wrap the dashboard layout (app/dashboard/layout.jsx), which would wrap route segments inside app/dashboard/*.

The two layouts would be nested as such:
