# Dynamic Routes

When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time.

## Convention
A Dynamic Segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets: [folderName]. For example, [id] or [slug].

You can use useParam hook to get the values in component/pages For ecample if your folder structure looks like `src/app/products/[productId]/index.jsx`

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function Product() {
  const { productId } = useParams();
  return (
    <>
      {productId}
    </>
  );
}

export default Product;
```

Alternatively:

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function Product({productId}) {
  return (
    <>
      {productId}
    </>
  );
}

export default Product;
```
