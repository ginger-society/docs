# Create app


You can easily create your first app using the GingerJs CLI.

To create a new app, run the following command:
```bash
gingerjs create-app
```

This will set up the basic structure for your GingerJs application.

## Run Server

After creating your app, you can start the server with the following command:

```bash
gingerjs runserver
```

Note: The runserver command will use the settings.py file present in the root to configure the environment settings. It automatically sets up the environment based on the configurations specified in this file, but do not add sensitive information to settings.py. Instead, set it directly in the environment variables or use env file.
