# Introduction

Welcome to the GingerJs documentation!

Unlike typical setups where Node.js serves as the backend for frontend applications, this project leverages Python to deliver a comprehensive full-stack solution.

# What ?

GingerJs is a Meta framework designed for developing full-stack web applications. It utilizes React Components to construct user interfaces and adds extra features and optimizations.

Behind the scenes, GingerJs abstracts and automatically sets up the necessary tools for React, such as bundling and compiling. This enables you to concentrate on creating your application rather than dealing with configuration tasks.

Whether you're working solo or within a larger team, GingerJs can assist you in building interactive, dynamic, and fast React applications.

## Main Features
Some of the main GingerJs features include:

Feature | Description
--- | --- 
Routing | A file-system based router built on top of Flask and Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, and more. 
Rendering | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with py-react.
Styling | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS

## Pre-Requisite Knowledge
Our documentation is intended to be beginner-friendly, but we need to establish a baseline to ensure it remains focused on Py-React features. We'll provide links to relevant resources whenever we introduce new concepts.

To get the most from our documentation, it's recommended that you have a basic understanding of Flask, HTML, CSS, and React. If you need to improve your React skills, check out this [React Foundations Course](https://nextjs.org/learn/react-foundations) and [Flask documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/), which cover the essentials.
